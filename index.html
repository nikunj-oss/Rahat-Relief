            Oxygen Cylinders
        </h1>
        <p>India faced a significant liquid medical oxygen (LMO) shortage when there was a sudden onslaught of Covid-19 crisis and most infected patients needed LMO support. Requests for oxygen cylinders flooded the social media.</p>
        <p>Government organisations, NGOs, and private sector quickly jumped to arrange LMO for the distressed victims.
            The requirement for LMO grew multiple times than the standard usage leaving many stranded due to an inadequate supply of this essential product.
            </p>
        <p>The production capacity of LMO in India is currently at around 7,000-8,000 tonnes per day. With demand approaching 9,000-11,000 tonnes per day, there is a capacity shortage of available LMO in the country.</p>

            Medicinal Crisis
        </h1>
        <p>
            Efficient public-procurement systems are critical for ensuring Access to Medicines (ATM) and enabling universal healthcare delivery. This is especially true of India where public healthcare caters to the underprivileged population who have limited access to medicines. However, essential medicine shortage in the Indian public-healthcare system is significant and is exacerbated by inefficiencies in the procurement system. Healthcare policy makers have to constantly contend with delays and non-fulfillment of medicine orders leading to shortages.

            Food Shortage
        </h1>
        <p>India was home to the largest number of undernourished people in the world even before the Covid-19 pandemic. The latest edition of the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World (SOFI) report, released jointly by five UN organisations in July, reveals that the pandemic and failure on the part of state to combat its effects, has led to a significant increase in the prevalence of hunger and food insecurity in the country.
            According to the data presented in the report, the prevalence of moderate to severe food insecurity in India rose by about 6.8 percentage points in 2018-20. In absolute terms, the number of persons facing moderate to severe food insecurity has increased by about 9.7 crore since the outbreak of Covid. The irony is that this happened when the government had an unprecedented 100 million tonnes of food grains in its godowns — larger than the food stocks of any country. The country with the largest stock of grain in the world — 120 million tonnes as of July 1, 2021 — accounts for a quarter of the world’s food-insecure population. Estimates show that, in 2020, over 237 crore people were grappling with food insecurity globally, an increase of about 32 crore from 2019. South Asia alone accounts for 36 per cent of global food insecurity.
